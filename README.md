I used the anomly detection algorithm for the unsupervised learning because Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data, which makes them useful in situations where labeled data is scarce or expensive to acquire. These algorithms can be used to discover patterns and structure in the data, such as grouping similar data points together or identifying outliers.

Anomaly detection algorithms, which are a type of unsupervised learning, are often used to detect sybil attacks. These algorithms can identify patterns or behaviors in the data that deviate from the norm, which can indicate the presence of a sybil attack.

There are several libraries in Python that can be used to apply anomaly detection algorithms, such as:

- scikit-learn: a popular machine learning library that includes several anomaly detection algorithms, including LocalOutlierFactor, OneClassSVM, and IsolationForest.
- PyOD: a library specifically designed for anomaly detection, it has several algorithm implementations and is easy to use.
- Tensorflow: a library that can be used to create and train neural network models, including autoencoders which can be used for anomaly detection.

I used the scikit-learn to implement this lego by using its algorithm Localoutlierfactor.
